# COILProject, Collaboration between students between Ajman University and Temple University

## Project Team: Ahman, Andrew, Lara, Iman, Sharron

## Product Description:
This project analyzes a superstoreâ€™s sales data to understand which customers would be most profitable. We look at factors like shipping methods, product types, and customer demographics. We aim to identify patterns that help drive profits for superstores. Our project takes superstore data, including shipping dates, order dates, etc... and creates a webpage that displays business model information and analytics. The webpage is guided by an analysis with JupyterNotebook and Microsoft PowerBI of business model data. The goal is to provide more insight for businesses to make smarter decisions through this interactive webpage and PowerBI business model.

## Important items:
#### customer_profitability.ipynb: python script with analytics on superstore data
#### Webpagescript.py: script for launching interactive web tool
#### Final_BI_Report_AU.pdf: BI report created by Ajman University
#### PowerBi(1,2,3,4,5).png: Slideshow png images of PowerBI analytics
#### superstore.csv: dataset used in project

## Resources:
#### Programming Language: Python
#### Libraries and Frameworks: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
#### Environment: Python and Conda
#### Database: CSV Files

## Ajman University contributions: PowerBI Business Model, IPYNB Python script with analytics (customer_profitability.ipynb).

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the implementation of a Gradient Boosting Classifier for customer profitability
analysis enables businesses to accurately identify and segment their customers based on
profitability, thereby facilitating targeted strategies that enhance operational efficiency and
maximize profitability. This analytical approach not only addresses the complexities of customer
behaviour but also provides actionable insights for improving underperforming areas and
fostering customer retention.
