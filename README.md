# COILProject, Collaboration between students between Ajman University and Temple University

## Project Team: Ahman, Andrew, Lara, Iman, Sharron

## Product Description:
This project analyzes a superstoreâ€™s sales data to understand which customers are the most profitable. By examining factors like shipping methods, product categories, and customer demographics, we aim to identify patterns that drive profits. Our project takes superstore data, including shipping dates, order dates, etc... and creates a webpage that displays business model information and analytics. The webpage is guided by an analysis with JupyterNotebook and Microsoft PowerBI of business model data. 

### Ajman University contributions: PowerBI Business Model, IPYNB Python script with analytics.
### Temple University Contributions: Gradio webpage displaying interactive platform for viewing data and business model.
