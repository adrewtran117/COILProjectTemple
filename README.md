# COILProject, Collaboration between students between Ajman University and Temple University

## Project Team: Ahman, Andrew, Lara, Iman, Sharron

## Product Description:
This project analyzes a superstoreâ€™s sales data to understand which customers would be most profitable. We look at factors like shipping methods, product types, and customer demographics. We aim to identify patterns that help drive profits for superstores. Our project takes superstore data, including shipping dates, order dates, etc... and creates a webpage that displays business model information and analytics. The webpage is guided by an analysis with JupyterNotebook and Microsoft PowerBI of business model data. The goal is to provide more insight for businesses to make smarter decisions through this interactive webpage and PowerBI business model.
